- **No requotes**, no dealer intervention
- Super-tight **spreads** (often 0.0 pip) 💹

## 🤝 What Is an STP Broker?

**STP** means **Straight Through Processing**. STP brokers forward your trades to **liquidity providers** but may use a small internal routing system before sending them out.

### ⚙️ Key Features:
- No dealing desk (NDD) model  
- Trades routed directly to LPs (liquidity providers)  
- **No commissions**, but slightly wider spreads  
- Faster execution than market makers  
- Less transparency than ECN

### 💡 Best for:
- Beginners 👶  
- Swing traders 🐢  
- Lower capital traders 💵
